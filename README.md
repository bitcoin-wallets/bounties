# XPR Network Blockchain Bounties Program

## Overview

The XPR Network Bounties Program is funded by the Community Warchest from the XPR Network Development Fund. It's designed to incentivize the community to contribute to the XPR Network's development and enhancement. Bounties are tasks or projects posted by the XPR Consortium or the community, where contributors can claim and solve them for a reward.

## Bounty Guidelines

Anyone with an XPR Network account can participate in the Bounties Program. All types of tasks or projects are allowed to be posted as bounties. However, tasks that improve the XPR Network's infrastructure, create new features, or solve existing issues are preferred.

### Requirements:

- Must have an XPR Network account
- XPR Network account must have KYC verification
- Must have proven experience or necessary skills to solve the bounty

The bounty rewards will depend on the complexity of the tasks and are decided by the bounty poster, with oversight from the XPR Consortium.

## Bounty Application Process

1. Check the `bounties` folder in this repo for open bounties
2. Choose a bounty that matches your skills
3. Claim the bounty by commenting on it
4. Once your claim is approved, start working on the bounty
5. When you're done, submit your work as a Pull Request

The XPR Consortium will review your work and if it meets the criteria, your reward will be approved.

## Review Process

After a bounty is claimed and the work is submitted, the XPR Consortium will review it to ensure it meets the criteria. The XPR Consortium may seek clarifications and you may address any feedback in writing. If we donâ€™t receive a reply within 2 weeks the claim will be closed. You may re-claim the bounty if it's still open.

Once the XPR Consortium agrees that the work meets the criteria, the reward will be approved by 3 members of the Consortium.

## Bounty Completion Process

Bounty completion and deliverables should be reported to the community via GitHub and will be monitored by the XPR Consortium. Failure to disclose progress and deliverables will result in delayed payment of the reward.

## Payments

Payments are made in XPR at the time of the bounty completion sign off by the XPR Consortium and the proposal msig is approved by 3 Consortium members.
